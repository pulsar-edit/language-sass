# Sass/SCSS language support in Atom
![CI Status](https://github.com/atom/language-sass/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)

Adds syntax highlighting and snippets to Sass/SCSS files in Atom.

Originally [converted](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/converting-from-textmate) from the [Sass TextMate bundle](https://github.com/alexsancho/SASS.tmbundle).

Contributions are greatly appreciated. Please fork this repository and open a pull request to add snippets, make grammar tweaks, etc.
